# README
In this API, i implemented CRUD and also secure passowrd and authentication.
Ideally if I was successfull in consuming it, I would have liked to display floated tenders to biders for transparency and and public participation.
In future, I welcome collaboration especially on the front-end for styling and consuming the API because as is of now, I couldn't log in myself because of authentication measures.
Any assistance to further develop the app would be welcome.
